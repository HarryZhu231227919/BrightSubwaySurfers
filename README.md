# Program Description
Game similar to the Google dinosaur run, however it is multiplayer (at least two players; allowing more than two is a stretch goal) and the characters are different colored monkeys. There will be a link given to each player who will then be able to invite a friend and race that other person. The player dies when they hit an obstacle or their character is stopped when they hit one and the first person to reach the end wins.
